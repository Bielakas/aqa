# AQA — Autonomous Query Assistant

AQA is a cockpit-integrated voice intelligence system designed to operate as an autonomous assistant.
Unlike chatbots or generic AI agents, AQA is mission-oriented, embedded, and focused on situational awareness.

## Functionality
- Situational awareness: tracks system and environmental parameters
- Voice interaction: accepts short verbal commands, issues concise responses
- Alerting: notifies deviations from expected conditions or flight plans
- Checklists & procedures: assists with verbal confirmation and task flow
- Flight integration: interacts with navigation data, sensors, and external logic
- Adaptive output: responses based on urgency, context, and pilot focus

## Form Factor Possibilities
AQA can be a software module, standalone device, or integrated system component.

## Purpose and Philosophy
AQA emphasizes autonomy, clarity, and presence. It is a minimal, focused crew member.

## Vision and Evolution
AQA is an open, modular concept. While initially focused on cockpit integration, its architecture supports future growth:
- Expanded aircraft roles (diagnostics, remote ops)
- Hybrid cloud/local operation
- Deployment beyond general aviation

This repository documents AQA as a living system — scalable, modular, and extensible.
