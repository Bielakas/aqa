# AQA — Autonomous Query Assistant

**AQA** is a cockpit-integrated voice intelligence system designed to operate as an autonomous assistant for mission-critical environments. Unlike generic AI chatbots, AQA is context-aware, embedded, and optimized for real-time situational awareness.

---

## Mission

To provide pilots and crews with a reliable, modular, voice-driven system that understands operational contexts, alerts on deviations, and helps manage workflows — even offline.

---

## Core Features

- **Embedded Autonomy**: Runs locally with no cloud dependency.
- **Real-Time Voice Interaction**: Responds to verbal commands, manages checklists, issues alerts.
- **Situational Awareness**: Monitors flight parameters, environmental data, and system status.
- **Customizable Architecture**: Compatible with aviation data sources and sensor interfaces.
- **Modular & Extensible**: Designed to integrate with existing avionics or standalone platforms.

---

## Target Platforms

- General and experimental aviation (cockpit integration)
- Unmanned and remotely piloted systems
- Research vehicles, test beds, and flight simulators
- Edge computing systems for industrial/transport use

*Note: Prototyping may involve low-power development boards or mobile devices, but production deployment targets robust embedded and certified platforms.*

---

## Development Philosophy

- **Hardware-Agnostic Core**: Can run on Linux-based systems, ARM SoCs, or custom avionics hardware.
- **Offline AI**: Integrates quantized language models, voice recognition (e.g. Whisper), and speech synthesis (e.g. TTS) without external servers.
- **Pilot-Centric Design**: Minimal, non-intrusive interface, prioritizing focus and safety.

---

## Vision

AQA is designed not as an assistant with personality, but as an intelligent crew member — clear, minimal, always aware, never distracted. As regulations evolve, AQA may support:

- Expanded roles in diagnostics, remote ops, and incident reduction
- Hybrid cloud-onboard scenarios with encrypted fallback
- Extensions into maritime, ground, and rescue systems
