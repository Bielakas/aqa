# AQA â€” Autonomous Query Assistant

AQA is a cockpit-integrated voice intelligence system designed to operate as an autonomous assistant. Unlike chatbots or generic AI agents, AQA is mission-oriented, embedded, and focused on situational awareness.

## ðŸ§­ Core Idea

AQA is not just another AI voice bot. It is a **voice-native system module** intended to live inside aircraft cockpits â€” assisting pilots with short, purposeful voice interactions.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features

- **Situational awareness**: monitors system and environment parameters
- **Voice commands**: understands key phrases, reacts accordingly
- **Alerting**: warns when flight conditions deviate from expected parameters
- **Checklists & flows**: acts as a verbal co-pilot
- **System integration**: links with navigation, sensors, mission logic
- **Adaptive output**: speaks with priority and brevity, not chatter

## ðŸ“¦ Form Factors

- ESP32-based voice modules (offline)
- Smartphone-based assistants
- Fully integrated avionics software
- Modular plugins for experimental cockpits

## ðŸ”§ Philosophy

Minimalist, focused, offline-first. AQA is designed to be dependable and present, not fancy. Itâ€™s a **crew member**, not a gadget.

## ðŸ”„ Roadmap (excerpt)

- Phase 1: Offline local prototype with TTS/STT
- Phase 2: Flight data input (GPS, sensors)
- Phase 3: In-flight voice interaction
- Phase 4: Autonomy + checklists + safety logic
- Phase 5: Open SDK for aircraft builders

## ðŸ“œ License & IP

AQA is not an assistant. It is your voice-based flight co-pilot.
